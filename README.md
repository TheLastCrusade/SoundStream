# SoundStream

**SoundStream** is an open-source Android app that provides a platform to crowdsource music playlist creation among friends. [*SoundStream Beta*](http://goo.gl/k0tXFT) is now available for free on the Google Play Store!

This product is currently in beta, so please keep an eye out for bugs! If you come across a scenario which you think may be a bug, please [create a new issue](https://github.com/TheLastCrusade/SoundStream/issues/new) or email us for support at SoundStreamHelp@gmail.com.

If you have other questions, we'll be adding to our [wiki](https://github.com/TheLastCrusade/SoundStream/wiki) over time. You can learn more about SoundStream and see what we've got coming down the pipeline!

## Concept

Users define one phone as the *Host* device - the mobile device connected to the audio source. When a mobile device is designated as a Host, an ad hoc Bluetooth network is created, which other SoundStream users can connected to as *Guest* devices. Guests can curate a shared playlist by transferring songs from any device in the Bluetooth network, and have full control over the music controls (play/pause/skip).
