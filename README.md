# SoundStream

**SoundStream** is an open-source Android app that provides a platform to crowdsource music playlist creation among friends.

## Concept

Users define one phone as the *Host* device - the mobile device connected to the audio source. When a mobile device is designated as a Host, an ad hoc Bluetooth network is created, which other SoundStream users can connected to as *Guest* devices. Guests can curate a shared playlist by transferring songs from any device in the Bluetooth network, and have full control over the music controls (play/pause/skip).

Keep in mind that this product is currently in alpha, so look out for bugs!
