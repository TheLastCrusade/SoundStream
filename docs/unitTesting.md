#Unit testing

Because Eclipse can be weird, here is how unit tests in fanClub-test must be run:
* Write non-Android style regular unit tests
* In your run configurations, make sure to use the Android JUnit test launcher
* Run your unit tests as normal JUnit tests

*I wrote this so that other people don't spend two days debugging only to find that you missed a single configurable.*
