/**
 * This class is the main entry point to send and receive messages in Sound Stream.  It implements a protocol
 * that represent serializable messages and file data in a series of packets.  This protocol is constructed
 * to allow multiple messages to be in transit at a time.  This means that control messages can be sent
 * while also transmitting large amounts of file data, which with proper prioritization should enable
 * the application to feel responsive and still accomplish the job of moving music around the network.
 * 
 * See MessageFormat and PacketFormat for specific information about those formats.
 * 
 * This protocol supports stacking multiple messages (in that same format) into the same stream.  Each message will
 * have a length that describes that message.
